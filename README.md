All in one Data Science projects - Beginners to Advanced 

Projects:

1) EDA Analysis - Perform an in-depth EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.
2) Classification - Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species.
3) Linear Regression - Predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, location etc using classic regression.
4) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Building an image classification system using PyTorch.
5) Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Analyze text data and and classify the sentiment expressed in that text (Sentimental Analysis).
6) Customer Churn Prediction - Predicting whether a customer will leave a service using Deep Learning.
7) Stock Price Predictor - Using historical stock data, predict stock prices using Deep Learning.
8) Face Recognition - Computer Vision (CV) application that can detect and identify faces in live video streams or static images.
9) Movie Recommendation - Implement both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation approaches.
10) Automated ML Pipeline - To develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that automates the process of feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
11) A/B Testing - Developing a Robust A/B Testing Framework for Conversion Rate Optimization

    ## 1\. Project Overview

    **Real-Time Face Recognition System** is a computer vision application that can detect and identify faces in live video streams or static images. This system has numerous practical applications including security systems, attendance tracking, personalized customer experiences, and access control.
    
    **Key Features:**
    *   Face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning models
    *   Face encoding/embedding generation
    *   Face matching against a known database
    *   Real-time processing with OpenCV
    *   Simple web interface for demonstration
    *   Model performance optimization
    
    **Project Components:**
    1.  Data collection and preparation
    2.  Face detection implementation
    3.  Face encoding generation
    4.  Database storage of known faces
    5.  Real-time recognition pipeline
    6.  Performance optimization
    7.  Web application deployment

## 3\. Dataset Dictionary

For a face recognition system, we need two types of data:
### 1\. Training Data (For Model Development)
*   **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: Standard dataset for face recognition (can be used for benchmarking)
    *   13,000+ images  
    *   5,749 people
    *   1,680 people with two or more images

### 2\. Application Data (Your Custom Dataset)
Create your own dataset of faces to recognize. This should be structured as:
**Each image should:**
*   Contain exactly one face
*   Be well-lit and front-facing (for initial version)
*   Be in JPEG or PNG format
*   Have minimum resolution of 128x128 pixels
    
**Metadata:**
*   Maintain a CSV file mapping person names to their encodings
*   Include image paths for reference

## 4\. How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: python -m venv venv -> source venv/bin/activate -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare dataset: Create a _dataset_ folder and Add subfolders for each person with their images
4. Run the training: python train.py
5. Run the recognition system: python recognize.py
6. Run streamlit app: streamlit run face_app.py

## Project Overview
This project will demonstrate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills using a real-world dataset. We'll use the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle, which is perfect for EDA as it contains various data types and interesting patterns to uncover. Perform an in-depth EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

## Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python 3.9
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

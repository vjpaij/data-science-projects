### 1\. Project Overview

Developing a Robust A/B Testing Framework for Conversion Rate Optimization. The primary goal of this project is to create a reusable and robust A/B testing framework that allows businesses to statistically evaluate the impact of new features, designs, or strategies on key metrics (e.g., conversion rate, click-through rate). This framework will enable data-driven decision-making by providing clear statistical evidence of whether a new variation outperforms the existing one.

In many digital products and marketing campaigns, it's essential to understand if changes made to a product or service lead to a positive impact on user behavior. Without a rigorous testing methodology, decisions are often based on intuition or anecdotal evidence, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes or misinterpretations of true impact. This project addresses this by providing a structured approach to A/B testing.

*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Move beyond guesswork by providing statistically sound conclusions.
*   **Quantifiable Impact:** Measure the true effect of changes on business-critical metrics.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Identify underperforming variations early, preventing negative impacts.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Foster an iterative development process based on empirical evidence.

### 3\. Dataset Dictionary

For this project, we will simulate a dataset representing an A/B test conducted on a hypothetical e-commerce website. The test aims to determine if a new checkout page design (Treatment group) leads to a higher conversion rate compared to the old design (Control group).

**Dataset Name:** `ab_test_data.csv` (simulated)
| Column Name | Data Type | Description

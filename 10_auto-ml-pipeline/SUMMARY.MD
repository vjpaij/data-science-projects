### 1. Project Overview

Automated Machine Learning Pipeline for Predictive Modeling: To develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that automates the process of feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. This pipeline will enable faster development of accurate predictive models, reduce manual effort, and improve overall model performance.

This project aims to create a robust and efficient AutoML pipeline that can be applied to various predictive modeling tasks (e.g., classification, regression). The pipeline will take a raw dataset as input and automatically perform the following steps:
*   **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load data from various sources, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.
*   **Feature Selection:** Automatically select the most relevant features to improve model performance and reduce complexity.
*   **Model Selection:** Evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm for the given task.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model to achieve the best possible performance.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the final model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques (e.g., cross-validation).
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using Streamlit for easy access and interaction.

### 3. Dataset Dictionary

Since the AutoML pipeline is designed to be versatile and work with various datasets, we'll create a _synthetic_ dataset for demonstration purposes. This will allow us to showcase the pipeline's functionality without being tied to a specific real-world dataset. We'll create a classification dataset.

**Synthetic Dataset Description:**
The synthetic dataset will contain 1000 samples and 20 features, including both numerical and categorical variables. The goal will be to predict a binary target variable (0 or 1).

| Feature Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature_1 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature, representing a measurement or quantity. |
| Feature_2 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature, representing another measurement. |
| Feature_3 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_4 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_5 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_6 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_7 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_8 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_9 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_10 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_11 | Categorical | Categorical feature with three possible values ('A', 'B', 'C'). |
| Feature_12 | Categorical | Categorical feature with four possible values ('X', 'Y', 'Z', 'W'). |
| Feature_13 | Categorical | Categorical feature with two possible values ('P', 'Q'). |
| Feature_14 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_15 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_16 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_17 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_18 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_19 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Feature_20 | Numerical | Continuous numerical feature. |
| Target | Binary | The target variable to predict (0 or 1). |
